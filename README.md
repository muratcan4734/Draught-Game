# Draught-Game

For this project I builded  2 spinners so that the board colours can be selected by the user. I have passed the colour values held by the spinner to the board creation function when the user clicks the Change Board Colour Button.

I used the Custom View structure to create 8x8 The Board draughts

I used 2 Text Views to show how many pieces are on the board in total.

I used a Reset Button to Reset the game.
